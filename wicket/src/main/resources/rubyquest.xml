      <text><![CDATA[In light of the apparent fact that interactive adventures are acceptable here, I've decided to continue Ruby here. For those who already saw the first part back when I had to post it on /r9k/, hopefully you'll just bear with me on this one and not provide any undue spoilers until we're past the end of the last one. A flood of /b/tards migrating from their dying board sort of put a damper on that attempt.<br><br>So, get out your parser interface and let's see what we can do here.]]></text>

      <text><![CDATA[Thanks for bearing with me, folks. It's been a fun TEN STRAIGHT HOURS I've been doing this (+2 hours prep beforehand for room design/drawing).<br />I'm sure you've already noticed I'm not particularly artistic, nor a particularly quick-draw. Today's portion of the adventure was fun, I learned some things about my limits (e.g. avoid action scenes like the monster fight, that took up a whole goddamn thread, even though most of it was the 40+ responses per image), and we made some progress.<br />I've been trying to give people more freedom with their actions since a lot of people were accusing me of railroading early on, so I hope that was a bit more fun as well.<br /><br />Don't worry, Ruby's story isn't over yet. There's still more to come, soon enough.<br />Thanks for your support, /tg/.]]></text>

Reactions, chatter, and theories can go here.<br /><br />To keep the thread free of clutter, please try to self-moderate. As always, try not to fill the thread with unnecessary or meaningless &quot;me too&quot; posts, seconds, or simply reactions. If you suggest something that others have already suggested multiple times, consider deleting your posts. However, mass-deletion of posts is not necessary and posting repeatedly for others to do this is unproductive. Please, just try to keep clutter down.

      <text><![CDATA[<div class="someone-elses-post"><p>Inspect the hatch thoroughly.</p></div>The keypad linked to the access hatch in the ceiling is a strange one. <br />It has a digit-lock AND a swipe-card slot, and it appears to be lacking power.<br /><br />Strangely, it is connected to the hatch with both an electric and apparently-organic cord. The fleshy cord reaches from one terminal to the hatch, as does an electrical wire. Crossing the electrical wire is a thing flap of burnt flesh and ash, which appears to be leading to the a set of contacts on the access card reader. <br /><br />It seems rather complex. Whatever the case, the burnt flesh appears to be evidence that the two cords have trouble working well together.]]></text>

All stories have to come to an end sooner or later.<br /><br />Thanks for your patience, your support, and your encouragement. It's been a blast.<br /><br />Also: Some people have been asking to donate, and I'm a little hesitant to accept free money from strangers but if you honestly feel like just throwing money at me I am not too proud to accept it. If you weren't going to or think it's a ridiculous idea then please continue as you were. <br />For the few crazy people who think this was somehow worth money, I'm flattered, just drop me a PM on IRC.]]></text>
