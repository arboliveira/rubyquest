What is Ruby Quest?
</p>
<div class="text optiontext">
<p>
Ruby Quest was a collective role-playing game that took place 
on the popular 4chan image-posting forums.
The creator, Weaver, proposed a game in the style of choose-your-own-adventure stories, 
presented as pictures drawn like an old-school text adventure game.
The community would suggest actions, then Weaver would pick the best choices, 
pretend the input was accepted and draw the next resulting outcome.
It started looking like innocent puzzle-solving with animal characters, but soon enough
Weaver's real intentions took over and for the two succeeding months everyone got hooked up  
by the most frightening survival horror tale ever.

Did you write it?
</p>
<div class="text optiontext">
No, someone by the nickname of Weaver did it. Weaver, if you're out there... you rock.  
</div>

<p class="text option">
Who are you then?
</p>
<div class="text optiontext">
I'm just another fan who spends too much time reading TV Tropes and eventually stumbled onto Ruby Quest. It completely blew my mind. I had to do this.  
</div>

<p class="text option">
Why did you do this?
</p>
<div class="text optiontext">
<ol>
<li>For easier repeated viewings... it was a pain running through the entire archive all over again trying to spot Weaver's posts.</li>
<li>Figured it would be something special to offer Weaver and the community in return for the priceless hours of entertainment.</li>
<li>Lower the entry barrier so lots more people discover Ruby Quest, who knows, someday even a studio executive who realizes how awesome a movie of it would be!</li>
<li>Show off my L337 HAX1NG SKILLZ ;-)</li>
<li>?</li>

</ol>

<p class="text option">
How did you do it?
</p>
<div class="text optiontext">
Having studied the HTML for the archives 
at <a href="http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/ruby.html">thisisnotatrueending</a>, 
I wrote a <a href="http://java.com">Java</a> application to download and convert them 
to the format here presented. I could not have done it without help from many free software libraries: 
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/lang/">Apache Commons Lang</a>, 
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/io/">Apache Commons IO</a>, 
<a href="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</a> and 
<a href="http://wicket.apache.org/">Apache Wicket</a>.
Thank you guys. Eventually I will clean up and share my source code, too.
